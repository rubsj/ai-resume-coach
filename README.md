# P4 — Resume Coach: Data-Driven Resume Failure Analysis Pipeline

> Generates 250 synthetic resumes across 5 fit levels, labels them for 5 failure modes, and proves via A/B testing (χ²=32.74, p<0.001) that writing template choice accounts for a 66-percentage-point difference in failure rates.

## Problem Statement

Job seekers frequently submit resumes with subtle but disqualifying flaws: skills that don't match the job description, experience level mismatches, hallucinated credentials, or awkward AI-generated language. Traditional resume advice is generic and untestable. This project builds a production-grade pipeline that generates controlled synthetic resume data, applies deterministic failure labeling (zero LLM calls, ~250ms for 250 pairs), validates labels with a GPT-4o judge, and runs a statistically rigorous A/B test across 5 writing templates — producing quantified, actionable evidence about what causes resumes to fail.

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[run_generation.py<br/>50 jobs × 5 fit levels<br/>= 250 resumes] --> B[run_labeling.py<br/>5 failure mode flags<br/>Jaccard similarity]
    B --> C[judge.py<br/>GPT-4o evaluation<br/>quality score 0–1]
    C --> D[corrector.py<br/>Instructor retry loop<br/>8/8 corrected]
    D --> E[analyzer.py<br/>9 charts<br/>pipeline_summary.json]
    E --> F[multi_hop.py<br/>4 reasoning questions<br/>per pair]
    F --> G[vector_store.py<br/>ChromaDB<br/>all-MiniLM-L6-v2]
    G --> H[api.py<br/>FastAPI<br/>9 endpoints]
    H --> I[streamlit_app.py<br/>5-page demo]
```

Each module reads from `data/` JSONL files and writes its output back to the same directory — clean, auditable, resumable at any stage. `DataStore` (in `data_paths.py`) loads all artifacts once at API/Streamlit startup for O(1) lookups.

## Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Resumes generated | 250 (100% Pydantic validation rate) |
| Jaccard gradient | excellent=0.669 → good=0.607 → partial=0.620 → poor=0.212 → mismatch=0.005 |
| Awkward language rate | 58.4% |
| Missing core skills rate | 50.8% |
| GPT-4o judge avg quality score | 0.541 |
| Correction rate | 8/8 = 100% |
| A/B χ² statistic | 32.74 (df=4, p=1.35e-06) |
| Best template | `casual` — 34% failure rate |
| Worst template | `career_changer` — 100% failure rate |

Skill overlap (Jaccard similarity) forms a near-perfect gradient across fit levels, confirming it is the dominant signal for resume quality. The A/B template test revealed a statistically significant 66-percentage-point spread between best and worst templates — actionable evidence that template choice matters more than content for reducing failures.

The Jaccard gradient from excellent (0.669) to mismatch (0.005) validates the entire labeling system — skill overlap is the dominant signal for resume fit.

</p>

A/B test across 5 writing templates: `casual` achieves 34% failure rate while `career_changer` hits 100% — a statistically significant 66-percentage-point spread (χ²=32.74, p<0.001).

</p>

Agreement between the GPT-4o judge and the deterministic rule-based labeler validates automation: the two systems agree closely enough to use the labeler as a low-cost proxy during development.

## Technical Highlights

**Instructor + Nested Schema Generation ([ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-instructor-nested-schemas.md))** — 250 resumes with 4 levels of Pydantic nesting (`Resume → ContactInfo, Skill[], Experience[], Education[]`) generated at 100% validation rate. Instructor's `max_retries=5` with automatic `ValidationError` injection turns blind retries into targeted fixes: the model sees exactly which of ~30 validation points failed. This eliminated ~100 lines of retry state machine per generation function. The same Instructor pattern from P1's flat 7-field schema scaled unchanged to P4's 35-model nested schema.

**Two-Phase Validation ([ADR-003](docs/adr/ADR-003-two-phase-validation.md))** — Structural validation (Instructor/Pydantic at generation time) is separated from semantic validation (labeler post-generation). The labeler is pure Python with zero LLM calls — deterministic, ~250ms for 250 pairs, and fully unit-testable with constructed fixtures. GPT-4o judge is optional Phase 3, controlled by `--skip-judge`. Mixing both layers into one would make testing expensive and debugging hard.

**Skill Normalization ([ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-skill-normalization.md))** — Custom 4-stage pipeline: lowercase → version stripping (`"Python 3.11"` → `"python"`) → suffix removal → alias resolution (`"ML"` → `"machine learning"`). Without this normalizer, `"Python 3.11"` vs `"Python"` scores Jaccard=0.0. The entire gradient from excellent=0.669 to mismatch=0.005 depends on canonicalization. A Day 1.5 audit discovered skills were being generated as full sentences instead of tokens — the pipeline "succeeded" but Jaccard was near zero. Schema-level field descriptions and prompt-level format rules fixed the root cause.

**ChromaDB Vector Store ([ADR-005](docs/adr/ADR-005-chromadb-over-faiss.md))** — `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embeddings (384d) for 250 resumes, persisted to `data/chromadb/`. A module-level `_ef` singleton avoids a 2s model reload per query. `where={"fit_level": ...}` metadata filtering narrows semantic search by fit tier. ChromaDB was chosen over P2's FAISS specifically for persistence and live API use — same embedding model, different infrastructure requirement.

**FastAPI with Pydantic ([ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-fastapi-over-flask.md))** — All 14 request/response schemas defined in `schemas.py` are reused directly as FastAPI endpoint parameters and `response_model` annotations, with no duplication. `Annotated[int, Query(ge=1, le=50)]` handles inline constraint validation on query parameters. Auto-generates Swagger UI at `/docs` with zero additional code.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are typed with Pydantic v2 request/response models. Interactive Swagger documentation at `/docs`.

## Engineering Practices

**Testing**: 532 tests (pytest), ~95% coverage. All labeler tests are fully deterministic with constructed fixtures — zero LLM mocking. API tests use FastAPI `TestClient` (equivalent to Spring MockMvc). Coverage ceiling is `api.py:52-53` (startup exception branch), which requires module reload to hit.

**Validation**: Two-phase architecture separates structural validation (Instructor/Pydantic at generation time) from semantic validation (rule-based labeler post-generation). The labeler runs 250 pairs in ~250ms at $0.00 cost — tests run in seconds without any mocking infrastructure.

**Data Quality**: A Day 1.5 audit discovered near-zero Jaccard overlap caused by skills generated as full sentences instead of individual tokens. The pipeline's success count looked fine; only inspecting the actual JSONL output revealed the problem. Fix: schema-level `Field(description=...)` constraints plus prompt-level format rules.

**Cross-Project Patterns**: Instructor (P1→P4), SentenceTransformer lifecycle management (P2→P4), Pydantic v2 schema design (P1→P4), ADR documentation (P1→P4). Each project reuses and extends patterns from prior work rather than reinventing infrastructure.

## Cost

Full pipeline run: ~$0.50 (250 resumes + 250 GPT-4o judge evaluations + corrections). Dry run: ~$0.05 (10 pairs, no judge). ChromaDB embedding and all labeling: $0.00.

## Key Insights

1. **Skill normalization is foundational, not optional** — Without the 4-stage normalizer, `"Python 3.11"` vs `"Python"` scores Jaccard=0.0. The entire gradient from excellent=0.669 to mismatch=0.005 depends on canonicalization. Normalization is also where the Day 1.5 data audit paid off: the bug was invisible at the pipeline level.

2. **Template choice matters more than content for failure rates** — A/B testing proved `casual` (34%) vs `career_changer` (100%) with χ²=32.74, p<0.001. This is actionable: fix the template before optimizing the content it generates.

3. **Separate structural from semantic validation** — Instructor handles "is it valid JSON with the right fields?" at generation time. The labeler handles "does the content make sense?" post-generation. Mixing both layers makes testing expensive and debugging ambiguous.

4. **Aggregate metrics can hide fundamental data issues** — The generation pipeline reported 250/250 successes on Day 1. Only a manual audit of actual JSONL output revealed skills were full sentences instead of tokens, causing near-zero Jaccard globally. Always inspect actual output files, not just success counts.

5. **Choose vector stores by deployment context, not benchmarks** — FAISS for P2's batch evaluation (in-memory speed, determinism). ChromaDB for P4's live API (persistence across restarts, metadata filtering). Same `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` embedding model; different operational requirements.
